## What company you work for and what they do
I work for the Airborne Early Warning Control System Project Office (AEWCSPO) which is a office within the Department of Defence's Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG). The role of AEWCSPO is to acquire new AEWC aircraft, manage their lifetime sustainment and eventual disposal, as well as acquiring upgrades throughout the lifecycle of the aircraft in order to ensure it remains a viable capability throughout its lifetime. The purpose of the Department of Defence is to defend Australia and its national interests in order to advance Australia's security and prosperity.


## Who your supervisor is, their job title, and their responsibilities in the company
My supervisor is Mr Simon Doering, who is a Systems Engineering Manager.
In this role Simon is responsible for overseeing a number of junior engineers (such as myself), as well as performing project management activities relating to project engineering activities, and liasing with relevant project stakeholders.

## Your job title, your job description/duties, and where you fit in to the company structure
My job title as per my payslip is "Electronics (Network) Engineer", however as this is a extremely common title that does not provide much detail the job title that people describe themselves as tends to be slightly different (i.e. two other Electronics Engineers in the team use the titles of "Radar Engineer" and "Communications and Data Link Engineer"). As such the title that I use as part of the team is "Software Engineer" due to the duties I perform.

The main duties that I perform are:
- Contract Governance - Directing contractor work, and ensuring that work completed by contractors is complete and to a level that is satisfactory.
- Policy Writing - Collating and understanding the various policies, standards, and laws that govern the work we do and projects that we develop, as well as creating our own policies when necessary (i.e. one does not exist, or policies that exist do not cover our use case).
- Acting as a Subject Matter Expert on matters relating to Software, ICT, and Cyber.

I fit into the company structure at the lowest level of engineer. Above me is an Engineering Manager, who reports to a Project Manager, who in turn reports to the Officer Commanding of the System Project Office. This is the highest level that I am likely to interact with, however there is two more levels of System Heads before you reach the Deputy Secretary who is the head of the CASG organisation within Defence.

## How you secured your internship
I am already employed by Defence, however my current role is in personnel which would not meet the relevance requirement for a FEIT placement, so I applied for a secondment to an area that would be more relevant. I initially tried to switch to a different role in my same workplace in Sydney, however there weren't any opportunities there. I ended up applying for both Adelaide and Canberra before I was able to secure a position in Newcastle.

## What you expect to learn from your internship
(include some Engineers Asutralia Stage 2 Competencies and UTS FEIT grad attr)

## How do you think this internship will be different from your first one
I think this internship will be considerably different from my first one. My first internship was as a software engineer writing code all day every day, whereas this internship I do not think that I will touch any code (except for excel macros). Instead I will be in a higher level position (project scope wise) where I will be influencing and approving software and system architecture, as well as writing policy documents that help to dictate business requirements in software applications.

Due to COVID restrictions in NSW I am currently working from home, below is a picture of my home office.
