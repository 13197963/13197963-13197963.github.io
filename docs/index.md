### Goal Setting Reflection
This week I had my workplace goals setting section, with my mentor Nundu. We had to hold the meeting via Teams due to being in COVID lockdown. This session allowed me to explain to Nundu my internship goals and things I was interested in, as well as for Nundu to provide feedback on the feasability of my goals and surface any ways that I could achieve them. This was achieved during the meeting.

During the meeting my feelings were somewhat apprehensive as it was really my first time interacting with Nundu, but by the end of it I was happy that she was willing to help and willing to ask around to help find tasks that achieved my goals. My ability to clearly explain what I needed to do and why helped Nundu to understand, and Nundu's understanding of the project and project teams helped her to come up with ways to achieve the goals. The main external factor was the fact that the meeting had to be done via Teams rather than in person, as that made collaborating on the goals document itself a little bit more challenging, but we were able to work around that. Overall I think we both performed quite well and were able to successfully achieve the intent of the meeting.

One thing that I learnt throughout the goal setting/development process is that planning your personal development throughout your career is extremely important if you want to progress your career, both in terms of promotion and being able to contribute to your team. This can be done by undertaking additional learning/training, such as doing a masters or courses, or it can come from less direct methods such as choosing to work on projects that are in areas that you are unfamiliar with.

By discussing with my mentor I have come up with two paths forward in order to achieve my goals.
1. Nundu will attempt to raise any tasks that meet my goals with me so that I can undertake them
2. I will surface my goals with my supervisor so that he is aware of what my goals are so that he can also help to see what opportunities are available
I will personally be more proactive in seeking out (mainly through asking around) new opportunities that will help me to achieve my goals. This suits me and the team as it means that I am able to achieve my goals while also contributing to the team, benefitting the team as I provide value to them, and benefitting me as I do not have to do extra work on the sides to achieve my goals.

## Task 1.3
**Task:** Arrange a face to face meeting with your supervisor to have an initial performance review ✔️

**Task:** Write a reflection about this process and result of the review (You should focus on one competency or attribute that needs to be developed). ✔️

Due to COVID restrictions the IPR meeting was held virtually rather than face to face. This posed some challenges as the form is really meant to be filled out by hand and does not play well with Adobe Sign. Going in to the session my expectations were that I would do relatively well, as I show up on time, do the work that I am expected to, and ask for help when I need it. My scores for communications and professionalism were lower than expected but this was due to my supervisor reducing them due to not being able to attend the workplace in person.

Overall I am happy with the scores that I recieved as I would like to think that I am a capable engineer and that I am able to effectively contribute to the workplace. Based off the scores the areas that I believe I need to work the most on are written communication and problem solving.

Written communication is important, especially in the age of remote working. In the context of what I do at work, this comes down to briefs written for senior staff and writing policy documents. Writing for clarity and ease of reading is especially important throughout an engineer's career as they will often be asked to summarise large amounts of technical data for a non-technical audience. Additionally, an engineer should be able to write in a way that is unambigious as this will ensure that their plans and instructions are followed correctly, reducing risk.

In talking to the Project Management Unit Technical Director (senior engineer & my supervisors boss) he suggested that it might be good for me to go over the documents that I originally drafted, and compare them to after they had been through the review and edit process (done by others) so that I could gain a better understanding of the type of language as well as the style of writing (i.e. tone, voice). This will help me develop my written communication skills as it will better illustrate areas where I am not up to standard, as well as provide examples of how things should be done. This as a tool/method works for me, as basing my learning off something I have already done makes it easier to judge my progress, as well as it not being something too drastically different from what I would normally be doing, meaning that I do not have to allocate large amounts of time outside of normal work hours to work on this. 

## Task 1.4
**Task:** Write a reflection on an experience on your internship that didn't work out as well as you expected. What did you learn from it and how can you use that experience to be a more effective professional ✔️

One of my tasks while working was to write a brief requesting permission from the Director Project Management Unit (DPMU) asking for funding approval to deploy a datacenter for one of our project teams to use. I developed this brief in conjunction with a series of meetings that Nundu was having with DPMU related both to this issue, and other aspects of the project. Overall I was quite happy with what I had created, and felt that it achieved the goals of the brief as I understood them. Unfortunately this did not align with the goals of the DPMU and the expectations of one of the other team leads, resulting in a response that was a list of things that needed to be fixed/improved upon and significant portions of the document that needed to be rewritten.

Overall this was quite disheartening to me as I felt that I had done what I could to the best of my ability. In hindsight I don't think that I should have taken it as personally as I did, in that the response that I got was to re-align the document to ensure that it met the outcomes it needed to, and those outcomes did not match the ones that I had originally been told. My role in this was that I based the requirements off the research of similar brief documents that I found, without investigating enough to see if those aligned with what was needed. Others' roles in this were, not providing me with the level of detail I needed to effectively complete the task, and providing semi-constructive feedback that came across as an attack ("Read the writing guide" reads to me as if my quality of writing is so poor I need to start over, but the intent was to tell me to change the ordering and style of the headings in the document). The only main external factor in this case was that it was difficult to ask for clarification on the feedback that I recieved as it was the last day for the person who sent it (technically he sent it 3 hours after he'd finished). Overall I felt that I performed relatively well, given that I immediately tried to gain extra context on the feedback as to what needed to be improved and make the changes necessary to improve the document.

The main thing that I learnt as a result of this event was that as an engineer I am going to have to balance varying expectations from many different business areas, and that they may not always align with each other. This can more broadly be applied to other aspects of working as an engineer, such as managing competing engineering standards and understanding how they apply to a project in order to achieve proper compliance. This can also be applied in the context of managing project timelines such that different stakeholders' expectations are met and working with other teams to ensure that different aspects of a project are able to join together effectively and achieve what is expected.

After talking with some of the other engineers and managers I decided that the best course of action would be to re-read the Writing Manual with a fine tooth comb, as this is the document that sets out the standard for how all documents and correspondance should be written (both in terms of writing style and formatting). If I consult the writing guide every time before I write a new document I will be able to ensure that I meet the standards set out within, and as I gradually get more and more used to writing in alignment with it I will need to refer to the guide less and less. This suits me as it is something that is easy to do, and will help me to build confidence that I am writing in a manner relevant to what is expected of me. This is also in alignment with the UTS Library Academic Writing Guide, which sets out that one of the most important activities when writing is to "Always make sure you clearly understand what is required. If you are unsure ask, your lecturers and tutors to explain", although the who to ask is different, the core idea remains the same.

## Task 1.5
**Task:** Review your initial performance review, and the reflection you wrote about it with your mentor or supervisor ❌
- Did you succeed in developing the area you wanted to work on?
- Consider the effectiveness (or otherwise) of the plan you wrote in stage 4 of your relfection.
	- If it worked, use the experience to write a Developing Competency Claim, or Developing Attribute Claim (as appropriate). If the plan didn't work, why didn't it work?
- Research a new method or tool you can use to develop this are, and write a new Stage 4 plan.


## Task 1.6
**Task:** Reflect on your development as an engineer over the course of your internship. ❌
- Consider a significant event, or sequence of events, that had a profound effect on you.
	- What was it?
	- What did you learn from it?
	- How did it change you?
	- How will you use this in the future?
